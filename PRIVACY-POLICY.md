Privacy Policy for DeskFit Chrome Extension

Last Updated: [Date, e.g., June 04, 2025]

Thank you for using DeskFit ("the Extension"), developed by [Your Name/App Name if you have one]. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension handles and how it is used.

Information Handled by the Extension:

DeskFit is designed to operate entirely on your local computer, within your Google Chrome browser. The Extension handles the following types of information:

1.  Pomodoro Timer State: This includes the current time remaining on your Pomodoro timer, whether you are in a work or break session, and the number of Pomodoro work sessions you have completed today. This information is used to manage the timer functionality.
2.  Water Intake Count: The number of glasses of water you have logged for the current day.
3.  Stretch and Exercise Settings (Future): If settings for reminder intervals become customizable, these preferences will be stored.
4.  Daily Reset Information: Dates are stored to track when daily counters (like water intake and completed Pomodoros) should be reset to zero (e.g., at midnight).

How Information is Stored:

All the information listed above is stored locally on your computer using Google Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. This means the data resides only within your browser's storage for the Extension and is not transmitted to, or stored on, any external servers or by [Your Name/App Name].

How Information is Used:

The stored information is used solely for the functioning of the DeskFit Extension:
*   To resume your Pomodoro timer state if you close and reopen the popup or browser.
*   To display your progress for water intake and completed Pomodoros.
*   To trigger alarms and notifications at the correct intervals.
*   To reset daily counters appropriately.

Data Sharing and Third Parties:

DeskFit does not share any of your data with third parties. Since all data is stored locally, we do not have access to it.

User Control Over Data:

You have control over the data stored by DeskFit. You can clear this data by:
*   Uninstalling the DeskFit Chrome Extension, which will remove its associated local storage.
*   Manually clearing "Cookies and other site data" or "Hosted app data" for extensions through your Chrome browser's settings (though this is a more general browser action).

Changes to This Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's store listing or through an update notice. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
