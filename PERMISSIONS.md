Permission: storage

Justification: "DeskFit uses this permission to save your settings and progress locally on your browser. This includes your current Pomodoro timer state (time left, work/break mode), the number of Pomodoro sessions completed today, your daily water intake count, and the last reset dates for daily features. This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere."

Permission: alarms

Justification: "DeskFit requires this permission to schedule and trigger timed events. This is essential for the Pomodoro timer to function (signaling work/break transitions), and for providing timely reminders for stretching, exercises, and drinking water at the intervals you've set (or by default)."

Permission: notifications

Justification: "This permission allows DeskFit to display on-screen alerts to notify you about important events. These include notifications for the completion of Pomodoro work/break cycles, reminders for scheduled stretch sessions, prompts for exercise breaks, and hourly reminders to drink water."

Permission: tabs

Justification: "DeskFit uses this permission to open a new browser tab when you interact with a stretch or exercise notification. This new tab displays the specific stretching GIFs or exercise instructions and associated timers, providing a dedicated space for you to perform the activity."
